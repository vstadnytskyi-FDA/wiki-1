# On DARPA's approach to funding research

Doing research is difficult, requires a very specific skills set, is unpredictable and is very expensive. Universities, institutes, laboratories and research groups spend millions of dollars, dedicating their lives to work in a direction that is interesting, of course, and is also promising to drastically improve people's lives. At least, that is what we claim while writing grants, research articles and presenting at conferences. The funding agencies do not want to give you a multi-year grant if you are not trying to solve a trillion-dollar problem.

When I was a graduate student working in the photosynthesis research field, I routinely read something along the lines "If we figure out how to reverse engineer photosynthesis, we can harvest trillions of kilowatts of power from sun and we will never have an energy shortage ever again". I am no saint, I have also written something very similar in my own proposals. By the end of the day, we have to justify why we need the money. You would say "But the funding agencies do have a requirement to report and publish papers to show that you are utilizing money and moving towards a solution". The reports do show that money was spent, equipment was bought and papers were published. But often the promises are not fulfilled, because in research (especially basic science research) it is hard to predict the outcome of the proposal. That is why researchers often hide behind the curtain of basic science research, and blame the unpredictability for not delivering what was promised.

Few recent Nature articles discuss the DARPA approach to funding. DARPA prefers to fund smaller (atomic if you wish), shorter (just a year or even 6 months long grant), more concrete projects (or building blocks) that fit into a bigger puzzle. The aim of the smaller grant is to prove or disprove, with an explanation, a concept, hypothesis or deliverable. In addition, they employ a shadow research team that conducts independent validation and verification.

After years of practicing this approach, DARPA learned that the cost of research can be reduced, and the quality be improved. Now many funding agencies across the US and abroad are trying to reproduce the success of DARPA. It would require drastic rethinking and redesign of the funding approach though, which will inevitably create huge resistance in the research community. By the end of the day, we are creatures of habits and we would fight until the end for what has always been righteously ours.
