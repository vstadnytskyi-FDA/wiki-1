# Where to start to learn aboutÂ yourself

For me, 2021 is the year I learned to trust my gut. I learned that when something feels wrong, it is wrong. If you feel it is wrong but you cannot put a finger on it Try to put a name to your feeling and identify a cause of why you feel the way you feel. Remember, you are not alone. Talk to your good friend and explain how you feel, or read a book or just google it. It is especially true for relationships, whether between friends, colleagues, or family. Do not be shy to reach out to your support system, the longer you wait more difficult it will be to even start talking about it.

If you experience misunderstanding with a colleague or with a good friend start reading about different ways scientists have developed to quantify your personal style.

Check out:
- Myers Briggs personality types
- DISC styles
- Analytical, Driver, Amiable, Expressive personality types

There are many resources online or locally where you live:

- Listen to management class
- or a youtube video by one of the professional organizations, such as OPTICA (former OSA), American Chemical Society(ACS) or American Physics Society(APS).
- Get a book from your local library (they are free!)
